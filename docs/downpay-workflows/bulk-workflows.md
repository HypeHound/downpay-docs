#### Steps

**1.** Navigate to the Shopify product page from the left navigation bar

**2.** Apply the necessary filters to narrow down your product list to the products you wish to add to a Downpay purchase option.

:::info Note
You may only add 1 page (50 Products) to a Purchase Option at a time.
:::

**3.** Select all the products you wish to add and click **...** at the bottom of the page and scroll down and select **Add to Downpay purchase option** under the Apps section.

**4.** Select which purchase option you would like to add the products to and confirm with the **Add Products** button. 

**5.** Continue this workflow to add as many products as you require to a purchase option.

:::info Note
There is no limit to how many products can be added to a purchase option however the limit on viewing them within Downpay is currently 250. To add large product catalogs, contact us and we can apply to all or specific tags.
:::

:::tip Tip
To manage more than 250 products within one purchase option, use the Product page per product to add or remove products from a plan. You may also delete a purchase option to quickly remove all products associated with that option. Bulk removal workflow is coming soon.
