  <summary>I need my deposits to be non-refundable. How do I communicate that with my customers?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>During checkout, customers are shown a link to your cancellation policy. If you would like to change the default text of the policy, you can do so in your Shopify Admin, under Settings > Policies. Enter your policy in the ‘Purchase options cancellation policy’ section.</div>

  <summary>Do you support adding products to a purchase option by collection?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Unfortunately Smart collections do not expose a way to detect when products are added or removed from them. That means we have no way to keep purchase option and smart collection membership in sync. To get around this, customers can use the bulk editor to add products to a purchase option.</div>
