## Storefront Questions

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I see deposit options on my product page?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>The main cause is usually that your store is not using Shopify Payments or the Paypal Express payment method with automatic payments enabled. Read more on our supported payment gateways guide. </div>
    <br/>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why do deposit options get removed on my cart or checkout?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>This issue is usually caused by a conflicting app removing the deposit plan from products during their workflow. For more help on compatibility, contact us directly for recommendations on compatible apps.</div>
    <br/>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I need my deposits to be non-refundable. How do I communicate that with my customers?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>During checkout, customers are shown a link to your cancellation policy. If you would like to change the default text of the policy, you can do so in your Shopify Admin, under Settings > Policies. Enter your policy in the ‘Purchase options cancellation policy’ section.</div>
    <br/>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why does it say "Subscription policy" on my checkout?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Shopify currently has a bug that displays "Subscription" instead of "Purchase Option" when Downpay is installed. To modify this, review our date management guide in the Workflows section.</div>
    <br/>
  </div>
</details>

## Setup Questions

<details>
  <summary>How do I add Downpay to all my products?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>You can use the bulk editor in the Shopify product page to add products in groups of 50. If you have a large product catalog, contact us at support@hypehound.io and we can add a deposit plan to all products for you or to specific tags.</div>
    <br/>
  </div>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Can I have more than one plan on a specific product?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Technically Downpay allows you to create more than one plan per product however only the first created plan for that product will appear on your storefront.</div>
    <br/>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you support adding products to a purchase option by collection?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Unfortunately Smart collections do not expose a way to detect when products are added or removed from them. That means we have no way to keep purchase option and smart collection membership in sync. To get around this, customers can use the bulk editor to add products to a purchase option.</div>
    <br/>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can Downpay be used to offer a trial instead of a deposit?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Downpay can be used to offer a trial period where the remainder of the payment is only collected if the product is not returned. Simply create a plan with the deposit amount you wish the trial to cost and choose a period of time to offer the trial with the "number of days after checkout" release date option.</div>

## Customer Workflow Questions

<details>
  <summary>How do my customers manage their Downpay orders?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>After installing Downpay, you can enable the customer portal using our guide found in the Initial Setup section.
