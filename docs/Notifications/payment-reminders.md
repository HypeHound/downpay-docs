By default, Shopify's notification system has options to set payment reminders based on the payment due date set in Downpay. 

For instructions on turning on these notifications, review Shopify's [Payment reminder documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/deferred-payments#set-payment-reminders)

## Automatic Payment Reminders with Shopify Flow
