## Creating purchase options using Downpay's interface

The goal of this guide is to help you create your first purchase option using Downpay's app interface.

#### Steps

**1.** Navigate to the Downpay app from the Shopify admin by clicking **Apps** in the left hand navigation bar.

**2.** Select **Downpay** from the search drop down.

:::tip Tip
Once Downpay is open, you can pin the app to your admin left navigation bar by using the ðŸ“Œ icon located in the top right of the app page.
:::

**3.** Click **Create purchase option** in the top right.

**4.** Name your purchase option by inserting a title into the **Purchase option name** field. This field will also be used as an order tag.

**5.** Click **Select product(s)** and use the search bar or select the product(s) you wish to create a purchase option for.

**6.** Select whether you would like to offer a deposit on your purchase option as either a percentage or an exact amount.

<!-- - To also enable the **Full Payment** purchase option, check the box titled  **Enable Full Payment Option** -->

**7.** Select the date at which you estimate your product will be available.
- Exact dates are useful for upcoming preorders with specific release dates. Exact dates can also be used as estimations and be changed later on.
- Relative dates are useful for custom made products or dropshipping

<!-- >:::info Note
  When using automatic payment collection, Downpay will collect any remaining payment on the date that is chosen. This can be changed per order.

**8.** Click **Save** to create the purchase option
:::info Note
Once you save a purchase option, it will become active. Ensure youâ€™re working on a draft product if you would like to make the option available at a later date.
:::


::: caution
In order for purchase options to appear in your theme on products, Shopify Payments or Paypal Express with `approved` Automatic Payment status must be enabled
:::

### Disable regular buy now option if Downpay purchase options exist on a product

By default, Downpay enables two options, a deposit and a pay in full option that goes through a standard Shopify checkout. You can disable pay in full on your purchase options.

:::info Note
Downpay purchase options are only available for certain sales channels and payment methods that are listed on [this page](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/purchase-options/subscriptions/setup#subscription-products) under **Eligibility requirements**. If you choose to only use Downpay purchase options, your customers may lose the ability to purchase these products on unsupported channels and payment methods.
:::

#### Steps

Uncheck the box named **Give customers the option to pay in full** under Deposit options when creating or modifying a Purchase Option and click **Save**.

#### Alternative method

**1.** Navigate to the Product index in Shopify and find the Product you created a Downpay option for and click it to open the product details page.

**2.** Scroll down and find the *Purchase options** section and check the box titled **Only show this product with these purchase options** to enable regular purchasing of this product alongside Downpay purchase options.


:::tip Troubleshooting
 If you do not see this box, ensure you have created a Downpay option for that specific product and hard refresh the page by holding shift and clicking your browser refresh button.
