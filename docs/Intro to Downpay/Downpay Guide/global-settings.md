### Order Tagging

Order tags support easier filtering within the Shopify order index. Shopify help article can be viewed [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-admin/productivity-tools/using-tags#filter-by-tag). 

Orders with Downpay plans support order tagging in 3 ways:

- App name (Downpay)
- Downpay Plan Name
- Not tagged

**Example**

A merchant wants to view all orders from a Downpay plan for custom made to product. 

- They have set their global order tag settings in Downpay to ************************************Downpay Plan Name************************************, in this case “Custom blue chair”.
- On the Shopify order index, they select ************Filter************ and **********************Tagged with********************** and fill in “Custom blue chair”
- They can now also save this filtered view using the **************Save as************** button in order to easily view all orders with this Downpay plan.

### Customer Account Self Service Cancellations

A merchant can choose to allow their customers to cancel orders from their respective customer accounts. To learn more about customer accounts, review this Shopify help documentation [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts).

### Automatic Plan Creation

In order to support faster plan creation without the use of Downpay’s user interface, merchants are able to create Downpay plans using product tags.
