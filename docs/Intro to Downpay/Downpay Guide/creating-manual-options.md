**4.** Name your option by inserting a title into the **Name** field. This **Name** will also be used as an order tag.

**5.** Click **Select product(s)** and use the search bar or select the product(s) you wish to create a option for.

**6.** Select whether you would like to offer a deposit on your option as either a percentage or an exact amount.

- To also offer a **Full Payment** option to be displayed, check the box that says **Enable Full Payment Option**


**7.** Select the date at which your product is available.
- Exact dates are useful for upcoming preorders with release dates
- Relative dates are useful for custom made products

### Disable regular buy now option if Downpay purchase options exist on a product

:::info Note
Downpay purchase options are only available for certain sales channels and payment methods that are listed on [this page](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/purchase-options/subscriptions/setup#subscription-products) under **Eligibility requirements**. If you choose to limit products to Downpay purchase options only, your customers may lose the ability to purchase these products on unsupported channels and payment methods.
:::

**1.** Navigate to the Product index in Shopify and find the Product you created a Downpay option for and click it to open the product details page.
**2.** Scroll down and find the *Purchase options** section and check the box titled **Only show this product with these purchase options** to disable regular purchasing of this product.

:::tip Troubleshooting
 If you do not see this box, ensure you have created a Downpay option for that specific product and hard refresh the page by holding shift and clicking your browser refresh button.
