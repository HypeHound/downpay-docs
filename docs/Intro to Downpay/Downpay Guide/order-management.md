# Managing Orders

## Statuses

Orders with purchase options will appear in your Shopify admin with a **Scheduled** fulfillment status. Orders with partial payments will have a **Partially Paid** payment status.

## Mixed cart orders

Downpay allows mixed cart orders. These orders will have multiple cards in the order details page and will appear **Unfulfilled** until the in stock items are fulfilled. The order status will then change to **Scheduled**. 

:::info Note
Mixed cart orders collect entire shipping cost and some taxes up front that represent the available products

## Payment collection

### Manual

Payment can be manually collected from the payment method on file for a specific order that has only been partially paid. 

#### Steps

**1.** Open the order you wish to collect payment on from the Shopify order index page in the admin

**2.** Click **Collect Payment** and choose the payment method you wish to collect from and confirm the charge in the next screen.

The order's payment status will now be **Paid** and you can begin fulfillment.


:::info Note
Shopify currently only supports one future payment date. This means that any order with more than one deposit will be charged the remainder amount upon the next manual or automatic payment collection.
:::


<!-- ### Automatic

TBD -->

## Fulfilling orders


Once the remainder of the payment is automatically or manually collected on an order with a Downpay purchase option, you can begin fulfillment. 

### Steps

**1.** Open the order you wish to start fulfilling from the Shopify order index page in the admin

**2.** Click **Fulfill Early** in order to release the fulfillment and allow you to begin your usual workflow.


:::caution Caution
Downpay and Shopify do not block fulfilling and shipping orders that are only partially paid. Ensure you have received the expected payment before fulfilling orders.
