# Managing Orders

## Statuses

Orders with purchase options will appear in your Shopify admin with a **Sheduled** fulfillment status. Orders with partial payments will have a **Partially Paid** payment status.

## Mixed cart orders

If you want to only ship products when everything is available, or piece meal. 


## Payment collection

:::info Note
Shopify currently only supports one future payment date. This means that any order with more than one deposit will be charged the remainder amount upon the next billing date that is reached. For manual payment collection, the same rule applies. 
:::

### Manual

Payment can be manually collected from the payment method on file for a specific order that has only been partially paid. 

#### Steps

**1.** Open the order you wish to collect payment on from the Shopify order index page in the admin
**2.** Click **Collect Payment** and choose the payment method you wish to collect from and confirm the charge in the next screen.

The order's payment status will now be **Paid** and you can begin fulfillment.

### Automatic

TBD

## Fulfilling orders

:::info Note
Downpay does not block you from fulfilling and shipping orders that are only partially paid, ensure you have received the expected payment before fulfilling orders.
:::

Once the remainder of the payment is automatically or manually collected on an order with a Downpay plan, you can begin fulfillment. 

### Steps

**1.** Open the order you wish to start fulfilling from the Shopify order index page in the admin
**2.** Click **Fulfill Early** in order to release the fulfillment and allow you to begin your usual workflow.

::info Note
Downpay will be automating this to support releasing fulfillments upon full payment.
