# General Settings

### Order Tagging

Order tags support easier filtering within the Shopify order index. Shopify help article can be viewed [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-admin/productivity-tools/using-tags#filter-by-tag). 

Orders with Downpay plans support order tagging in 3 ways:

- App name (Downpay)
- Downpay Plan Name
- Not tagged

**Example**

A merchant wants to view all orders from a Downpay plan for custom made to product. 

- They have set their global order tag settings in Downpay to ************************************Downpay Plan Name************************************, in this case “Custom blue chair”.
- On the Shopify order index, they select ************Filter************ and **********************Tagged with********************** and fill in “Custom blue chair”
- They can now also save this filtered view using the **************Save as************** button in order to easily view all orders with this Downpay plan.

### Customer Account Self Service Cancellations

A merchant can choose to allow their customers to cancel orders from their respective customer accounts. To learn more about customer accounts, review this Shopify help documentation [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts).

### Automatic Plan Creation

In order to support faster plan creation without the use of Downpay’s user interface, merchants are able to create Downpay plans using product tags.

## Managing Downpay Orders

Once the remainder of the payment is automatically or manually collected on an order with a Downpay plan, you can begin fulfillment. To start, click ************************Fulfill Early************************ in order to release the fulfillment and allow you to begin your usual workflow.

Note: We will be automating this to support releasing fulfillments upon full payment.

# FAQs

- I need my deposits to be non-refundable. How do I communicate that with my customers?
    
    During checkout, customers are shown a link to your cancellation policy. If you would like to change the default text of the policy, you can do so in your Shopify Admin, under Settings > Policies. Enter your policy in the ‘Purchase options cancellation policy’ section.
    
- How do my customers manage their Downpay orders?
    
    In the Downpay general settings, you can enable cancellations using customer accounts. This will allow customers to manage their deposit orders without contacting your customer support. 
    
- Can I have more than one plan on a specific Product?
    
    Technically Downpay allows you to create more than one plan per product however only the first created plan for that product will appear on your storefront.
