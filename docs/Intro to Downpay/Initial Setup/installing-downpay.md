## Installing Downpay

To begin, install Downpay from Shopify App Store located [here](http://test.com). 

- You will be asked to approve Downpay’s access to your Store by reviewing permissions and clicking Install App.

### Permissions

Below we have listed our permissions details and reasoning:

| Permission | Reasoning |
| --- | --- |
| Customers | Downpay enables a ‘buyer portal’ through which customers can view and manage orders they have made with the help of the app. |
| Orders | Downpay keeps track of orders which were processed using a deposit option, in order to enable core app features. |
| Products | Since Downpay plans are associated with products, the app requires this access scope in order to keep track of products and associate them with core functionality. |
| Purchase Options | Purchase Options enable Downpay to create different selling plans on products, such as deposits. |
| Payment Terms | With each order enabled through the app, the buyer’s payment information is stored in a secure vault made available by Shopify. This access scope allows the app to read these payment terms, so that it can help manage workflows around orders and deferred payments on those orders. |
| Payment Mandates | This access scope allows the app to issue a charge to the buyer’s credit card at a time later than checkout - for example, an order where the buyer is charged a deposit upfront but is then charged the remainder at a later date. |

- Once approved, you’ll arrive at the Downpay New Merchant Onboarding where we will install theme snippets and prepare your first Downpay Plan.

### Billing

Later on during the private beta we will release pricing plans and introduce billing selection screens to installation.
