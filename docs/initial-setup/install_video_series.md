This 5-ish minute video series will help you get started with Downpay quickly! Our in-app onboarding guide also helps you get started quickly. If you'd prefer our help with your setup, please contact us anytime at [support@hypehound.io](mailto:support@hypehound.io).

<details><summary>1. Set up a supported payment gateway</summary>
<p>

#### Set up a supported payment gateway: Shopify Payments or Paypal Express with Automatic Payments approved

<p></p>

Shopify limits deposits to these two gateways. In order to see deposit options on your storefront, you must enabled one of these gateways to proceed with setup.

To enable Shopify Payments, review Shopify's documentation found [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/setting-up-shopify-payments)

For Paypal express with automatic payments, review [enabling Paypal Express](/payment-gateways#enabling-paypal-express).
