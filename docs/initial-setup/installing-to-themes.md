#### Cart block

The cart block features an amount due today and an amount due later. Currently these are not customizable but CSS can be used to adjust the look and feel.


## Legacy Themes

To install Downpay into legacy themes, Downpay's onboarding offers a once click theme install button with an app embed. Make sure to hit save after the embed has been enabled.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the **app embeds** section of the respective theme in Shopify's theme editor and toggle the Downpay embed on. 

You may also click the Downpay Embed for several options to help you design the look and feel of your purchase option box.

### Modifying placement of the embed 

In the Downpay embed, the **HTML element to insert after** will allow you to move the purchase option box around the product page. The box will be inserted after the selector that is in the box. 

Two options to modifying the placement of the box are:
- Unique element id attribute
- Unique CSS Class

#### Steps

1. Locate the HTML element that you want to insert the box after

2. Find the unique CSS or element id attribute and then insert this into the box in the Downpay embed

**Example** 
Letâ€™s say you want to insert after this element under the cart button, find HTML element you want to insert under and determine it's unique css class or unique element id attribute. 

In this example I want to insert the options below the add to cart button so my id would be **addToCartForm-product-template**. The classes are likely not unique and may cause issues.

```html
<button type="submit" name="add" id="addToCart-product-template" class="btn btn--large btn--full">
    <span class="add-to-cart-text">Preorder</span>
</button>
```
As for syntax, classes will be inserted as `.class` and element ids will be `#id`.
