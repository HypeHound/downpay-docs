## Ways to use Downpay for deposits

Downpay enables partial and deferred payments. This functionality enables a variety different selling strategies. Check out the most popular ways below.

### Preorders

If you are releasing a new product and want to gauge demand to map out production, you can use Downpay to give customers a way to leave a deposit while they wait for your product to release. This helps your business manage customer expectations and makes them feel more comfortable especially if shipping date is months away.

### Made to Order

If you make custom products on demand or offer commissions, Downpay is a great way to take an upfront deposit and only charge the remainder once you're ready to ship the product out.

### Bookings

If you run workshops or selling travel packages and want to take a deposit to secure a spot and charge the remainder the day before a booking, deposits help you with this.

### Try before you buy

If you're looking to offer customers the chance to try products before being charged, you can defer payment for a given amount of time and only charge if the customer does not return the product within the window.

### Out of Stock

If you've run out on products that are coming back in stock soon, you can use Downpay to allow customers to continue buying and holding their place in line. If you're used to back in stock notifications alone, Downpay is a way to level up your selling strategy by offering a minimal deposit at checkout. This will ensure a customer's payment method is saved on file and you're able to charge it once the product is ready to ship, rather than hoping they return to buy the product from you via their back in stock notification.

### High-end Products

If you're selling products that are challenging for customers to pay off in full at checkout, you can use Downpay as a layaway solution to split their payment in two and make it easier on their wallets. This method is also useful when your high end products are coupled with long shipping times.
