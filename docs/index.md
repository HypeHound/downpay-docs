# Overview

Learn more about use cases for Downpay, features, pricing, and where to get help.

## Use cases

There are many ways to use Downpay to provide customers with more payment flexibility. The most popular use cases are listed below.

### Preorders

If you are releasing a new product and want to gauge demand to map out production, you can use Downpay to give customers a way to leave a minimal deposit while they wait for your product to release. This helps your business manage customer expectations and makes them feel more comfortable especially if shipping dates are months away.

### Made to Order

If you want to make products on demand or offer commissions, Downpay is a great way to take an upfront deposit and only charge the remainder once you're ready to ship the product out.

### Out of Stock

If you've run out on products that are coming back in stock soon, you can use Downpay to allow customers to continue buying and holding their place in line. If you're used to back in stock notifications alone, Downpay is a way to level up your selling strategy by guaranteeing customers can commit to the purchase up front. 

### High-end Products

If you're selling products that are challenging for customers to pay off in full at checkout, you can use Downpay as a layaway solution to split their payment in two and make it easier on their wallets. This method is also useful when your high end products are coupled with long shipping times.

### Try before you buy

If you're looking to offer customers the chance to try products before being charged, you can defer payment for a given amount of time and only charge if the customer does not return the prdouct within the window.
